<h1>Using Spine and NodeJS</h1>

<p><a href="http://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a> is essentially a way of using Google's <a href="http://code.google.com/p/v8/">V8 JavaScript</a> engine for running JavaScript on the server side, taking advantage of its blazing speed and evented IO. Node provides a similar environment for scripts as in Google Chrome, with the exception of a DOM. Spine has special Node support, so everything that doesn't touch the DOM will work as usual, such as <code>Spine.Events</code>, <code>Spine.Class</code> and <code>Spine.Model</code>. The only component to Spine that won't work with NodeJS is <code>Spine.Controller</code>; as it relies on the DOM so even loading controllers will cause errors.</p>

<p>So why would you want to use Spine with Node? Well for a start Spine's classes and models are just as useful server side as they are client side - and you can use them to structure and modularize your code. More importantly though, it paves the way for code re-use between server and client. You could potentially use the same models, classes and libraries on both the client and server side. Finally, you can run automated unit-tests in Node, testing your client-side code.</p>

<p>Spine's API in Node is exactly the same, the one difference being you first need to fetch a reference to the library using <code>require()</code>.</p>

<pre><code>var Spine = require("./spine");

var MyClass = Spine.Class.create({
  sameApi: "asUsual"
});
</code></pre>

<h1>Exports</h1>

<p>By default NodeJS encapsulates code preventing global scope pollution. If you want your client-side scripts to work with Node you'll have to explicitly expose any variables you want to be global. This is done by using the <code>exports</code> object, setting global variables as properties on it. To allow your scripts to run in either a server or client side environments, you can check to see if it exists, creating it if otherwise.</p>

<pre><code>(function(){
  // Set exports to global context unless defined
  if (typeof exports == "undefined")
    var exports = this;

  // Expose MyClass
  exports.MyClass = Spine.Class.create();
})();
</code></pre>
