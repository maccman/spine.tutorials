#Spine Tutorials

[Spine](http://maccman.github.com/spine) is a framework for building MVC JavaScript Applications. Please see the project's page for more information, documentation and examples. 

These tutorials are designed to show you how to easily solve some of the most common problems people come across when building web applications using Spine. They're completely practical, and should easily transfer over to your custom use cases.

You should briefly read the [existing documentation](http://maccman.github.com/spine), if you're unfamiliar with Spine, before delving into these tutorials. It'll help with some of the concepts, such as MVC.

* [Layout tutorial](layout.html) - explains how to implement tabs, show/hide views and dynamic sidebars.

* [Form tutorial](form.html) - explores how to receive form details and update records.

* [Server tutorial](server.html) - explains how to sync up your Spine application with a server using Ajax and REST.
